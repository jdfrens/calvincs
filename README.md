# FORMER Website for the Computer Science Department at Calvin College

**This is no longer used or maintained, and it's so very old that it's probably the worst Rails example which will teach you how to do things wrong.**

This ~is~was a Ruby on Rails app for the Computer Science Department at
Calvin College.  It's developed almost entirely by one person
stumbling his way through Rails.

Potential features of the site:

* a CMS
* images (with random selection on CMS pages)
* faculty/staff management
* news items
* events
* a minimal course-catalog system


## Setup the App

1. git clone git://github.com/jdfrens/calvincs.git
1. cd calvincs
1. rake calvincs:setup
1. rake spec
1. rake cucumber
1. ./script/server
