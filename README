This is a Ruby on Rails app for the Computer Science Department at
Calvin College.  It's been developed almost entirely by one person
stumbling his way through Rails.

Potential features of the site:
  1) a CMS
  2) images (with random selection on CMS pages)
  3) faculty/staff management
  4) news items
  5) events
  6) a FAQ system (partially implemented)
  7) a minimal course-catalog system
