This is a Ruby on Rails app for the Computer Science Department at Calvin College.
It's been developed almost entirely by one person stumbling his way through Rails.

Potential features of the site:
  1) a CMS
  2) images (with random selection on CMS pages)
  3) faculty management
  4) news items
  5) events (in progress)
  6) a FAQ system (partially implemented)
  7) a course-catalog system (partially implemented)
  

CS Department Setup
===================

1. Create a config/database.yml.  You might be able to use config/database.example without too much trouble.
2. Create the databases with rake db:create
3. Start doing RoR.
